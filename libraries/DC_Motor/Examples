EXAMPLES

1) Rotate DC motor forward and reverse at full speed (no speed control)

/*this program will rotate DC motor forward for 5 sec
then stop for 2 sec and again rotate motor reverse for 
5 sec, stop for 2 sec continuously

#include <DC_Motor.h>
 
DC_Motor motor(8,12);
 
void setup() 
{
  
}
 
void loop() 
{
  motor.forward();
  delay(5000);
  motor.stop_motor();
  delay(2000);
  motor.reverse();
  delay(5000);
  motor.stop_motor();
  delay(2000);
}






2) Rotate DC motor forward and reverse at set speed (with speed control)

/*this program will rotate DC motor forward for 5 sec
at 40% speed then stop for 2 sec and again rotate motor reverse for 
5 sec at 80% speed continuously

#include <DC_Motor.h>
DC_Motor motor2(9,10,1);
void setup() 
{
  
}
 
void loop() 
{
  motor2.set_speed(40);
  motor2.forward_with_set_speed();
  delay(5000);
  motor2.motor_speed_zero();
  delay(2000);
  motor2.set_speed(80);
  motor2.reverse_with_set_speed();
  delay(5000);
  motor2.motor_speed_zero();
  delay(2000);
  }







3) Apply jog to motor in both direction with and without speed control

/*this program applies jog to two different DC motors
 * it applies jog to 1st motor in full speed in both direction
 * and then provides jog to 2nd motor with 80% speed in reverse
 * direction and 30% speed in forward direction
 * created by Ashutosh M Bhatt (+91-9998476150), Gujarat (INDIA)

#include <DC_Motor.h>
 
DC_Motor motor(8,12);
DC_Motor motor2(9,10,1);
void setup() 
{
  
}
 
void loop() 
{
  motor.jogg_full_speed(1);
  motor.jogg_full_speed(0);
  motor2.jogg_set_speed(0,80);
  motor2.jogg_set_speed(1,30);
}









4) Apply soft start and smooth stop to motor

/*this program will give soft start to motor and increase its speed
from 0 to 90% in 10 sec in forward direction
then it gives smooth stop from 90% to 0 in 5 sec
again soft start from 0 to 50% in 6 sec in reverse direction
and finally smooth stop from 50% to 0 in 3 sec
